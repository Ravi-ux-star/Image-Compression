#  Image Compression using K-means

 image compression project  utilizes artificial intelligence and the K-means algorithm to achieve efficient image compression while maintaining acceptable image quality. 
 This project offers a customizable compression solution by adjusting the number of clusters, allowing you to control the compression percentage.

## Key Features
- Utilizes K-means clustering algorithm for image compression.
- AI-powered solution for efficient image compression.
- Customizable compression percentage by adjusting the number of clusters.
- Easy-to-use and adaptable to various image formats.
- Preserves acceptable image quality while reducing file sizes.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeepPixel.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the image compression script: `python compress_image.py input_image.jpg --clusters 16`
   (Replace `input_image.jpg` with your own image and adjust the number of clusters as desired)

## Project Structure
- `compress_image.py`: Main script for image compression using the K-means algorithm.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for image processing and visualization.
- `input_image.jpg`: Example input image for testing the compression.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Pillow
